# ✈️ ShotPlane Game

ShotPlane is a 2D airplane shooting game that runs on the Telegram Mini App platform. 

## 📖 Introduction

ShotPlane is a classic airplane shooting game developed for the Telegram Mini App. Players control an airplane to shoot down enemies and score points. The game offers an engaging experience with simple yet captivating graphics.

Shotplane is designed with three core features:

Play to Free: Users can enjoy the game without any initial investment, lowering the entry barrier and attracting a wider audience. We create more attractive elements for gameplay so that players feel comfortable and entertained when participating in the game.
Play to Airdrop: Players are encouraged to join ShotPlane to have the chance to receive token airdrops, adding an extra layer of excitement and promoting active participation.
Play to Earn: To retain players after airdrop events, we have designed the play-to-earn feature, rewarding regular players. In-game rewards can be converted into real-world value, providing financial incentives and fostering long-term engagement with the project.
